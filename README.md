JavaScriptmas is a 24-day long, daily coding challenge in JavaScript (with some HTML and CSS), organized by the Norwegian online coding school, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), starting from December 1st until December 24th. 

In this repository I'm committing all of my solutions to this year's exercises. 2021's submissions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/boglarkasebestyen/javascriptmas2021) (I skipped 2022).

Scrimba's JS Advent Calendar, containing all of the exercises, can be found [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas).

## Day 3 - Divide Candy
- Challenge:
	- Some children have got some pieces of candy. 
	- They want to eat as much candy as they can but each child must eat exactly the same amount. 
	- Determine how many pieces of candy can be eaten altogether. 
	- A piece of candy can not be split.
 
 - Example:
 
	- Children: 3, Candies: 10
	- Each of the 3 children can eat 3 candies. 
	- Therefore, the total number of candies that can be eaten is 3*3 = 9, so the function calcTotalCandies should log out 9.

## Day 4 - AI Christmas Joke Generator
 - üéÑ Challenge:
 	- When clicked, the doors should open to reveal a festive joke.
 - üéÅ Hints:
 	- Use an eventListener to listen for clicks
 	- The OpenAI API is the easiest API for this challenge but you can also try with HugginfFace.
 	- For OpenAI you will need to use the chat completions endpoint, which you can read about in the docs here: 
    https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create
    - For HuggingFace, I would recommend using the "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" model. Check out these docs to get you going: https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface.js/inference/README, prompt design tips: https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta
    - The HTML and CSS have been done for you, but feel free to make changes if needed.

## Day 5 - Jeopardy Card Flip
- Card has two sides, and flips from front to back on hover
- Match stules as closely as you can
- CSS only
- Don't worry about responsiveness
- Hints:
	- A card flip is essentially an element rotating 180 degrees in 3D space. Use .card class to create the flip effect, then show and hode the front and back content as the card flips
	- Use the transition property for a smooth flip
	- The CSS properties transform-style: preserve-3D and backface-visiblity will help you along the way

## Day 8 - Animated Progress Bar
- Build a CSS animation of a progress bar filling to 100%. The animation should run continuously, with a small pause when the bar is filled 100%
- The progress begins red, turns blue at 50% full, and green when complete
- CSS only!

- Hints:
	- It may help to think of the progress bar as two elements, one on top of another: an outer progress bar and an inner progress bar. How can you use the width of the inner progress bar to create the effect of the outer progress bar filling?
	- Use the animation property and keyframes to complete this challenges. There's no way to pause an infinite animation between iterations, so to create the effect of a "pause" once the progress bar has filled to 100%, you may need an extra key frame

JavaScriptmas is a 24-day long, daily coding challenge in JavaScript, organized by the Norwegian online coding school, [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/), starting from December 1st until December 24th. 

In this repository I'm committing all of my solutions to this year's exercises. 2021's submissions can be viewed [here](https://github.com/boglarkasebestyen/javascriptmas2021) (I skipped 2022).

Scrimba's JS Advent Calendar, containing all of the exercises, can be found [here](https://scrimba.com/learn/javascriptmas).

## Day 2 - Style a Colorful Button
- Gradient border
	- use provided colors or choose your own
	- gradient is 115 degrees

	- the text changes from gray to white
- Center button on page
- Hints and help: 
	- gradient border effect can be accomplished using a wrapping div OR with the border-image property

## Day 3 - Divide Candy
- Challenge:
	- Some children have got some pieces of candy. 
	- They want to eat as much candy as they can but each child must eat exactly the same amount. 
	- Determine how many pieces of candy can be eaten altogether. 
	- A piece of candy can not be split.
 
 - Example:
 
	- Children: 3, Candies: 10
	- Each of the 3 children can eat 3 candies. 
	- Therefore, the total number of candies that can be eaten is 3*3 = 9, so the function calcTotalCandies should log out 9.
